# Quantum Computing 

> Random quantum circuits and projects I made while exploring the wonderful world of quantum computation

## What's Inside? 

This repository contains a collection of quantum computing implementations and experiments, built with curiosity and a love for quantum mechanics. Each project explores different aspects of quantum algorithms and circuit design.

### Current Projects

**Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm** (`Deutsch-Jozsa_algo.py`)  
An implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, one of the earliest examples of quantum advantage. This algorithm determines whether a function is constant or balanced, requiring only a single query compared to classical approaches.

**Quantum Coin Simulation** (`quantum_coin.py`)  
A quantum take on the classic coin flip, exploring superposition and measurement in quantum systems. Watch as quantum coins exist in multiple states simultaneously before collapsing to a definite outcome.

**Random Circuits** (`random_circuits.py`)  
Generating and analyzing random quantum circuits to explore circuit behavior, gate combinations, and quantum state evolution. Perfect for understanding how different quantum operations interact.

## Getting Started (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

Each script can be run independently:

```bash
python Deutsch-Jozsa_algo.py
python quantum_coin.py
python random_circuits.py
```

## About This Project ˚₊۶ৎ˙⋆

This repository serves as my personal playground for quantum computing experiments. Whether you're a fellow quantum enthusiast or just starting your journey into the quantum realm, feel free to explore, fork, and build upon these implementations.

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in how we process information, leveraging the strange and beautiful properties of quantum mechanics like superposition and entanglement. These projects aim to make these concepts more tangible and accessible.
